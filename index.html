    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Kobe Bryant: A Laker Legend</h1>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">Kobe Bean Bryant was drafted out of Lower Merion High School in the 1996 National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft as the 13th pick in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets. The Hornets then traded Bryant to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he would spend the remainder of his 20 year career.</p>
    
    <p style="font-family:courier;">Bryant started off his career by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, becoming the youngest player to ever win it. At just 18 years old, Bryant was already accomplishing things that had never been done before, and will never be done again. <br>In 1998, Bryant was honored as an NBA All-Star starter, becoming the youngest person to ever achieve that status. </p>
    
        <p style="font-family:courier;">However, Kobe did not start his true Laker Legacy until 2000, when he won his first NBA title. That was only the start though. The Lakers would go on to 3-peat by winning the NBA Championship in 2000, 2001, 2002. After a long stretch, the Lakers, led by Bryant, returned to win the NBA title again in 2009 and 2010. Having <em>five NBA Championships</em> made Kobe a legend in the Laker record books. During his tenure, he also took America to the top by helping win two Olympic gold medals playing for team USA. As Kobe Bryant said, <q>I focus on one thing and one thing only-that's trying to win as many championships as I can.</q></p>
